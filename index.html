                        <p>Essex is going to change a lot over the next 20 years. By 2035, the number of people aged over 85 will more than double. More of us will work from home, with some 5.5 million of us doing so by 2030. More of us will rent our homes than buy them. Our roads and railways will get busier – Essex already has the third highest road use in Britain and this is expected to increase by 32 per cent over the next few decades.
                        <p>But whatever Essex looks like, we want to make sure it’s still the Essex we all love. Partners from across Essex have got together and we want your help in developing a shared vision for Essex.</p>
                        <p>There will be a further chance to get involved and share your thoughts about the vision for Essex next year.</p>
